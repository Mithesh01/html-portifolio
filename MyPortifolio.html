      <li><h3>Voice Translator</h3></li>
      <p>
        Developed a real-time voice translator application that captures spoken
        input in one language, converts it to text using speech recognition,
        translates it into a target language, and outputs the translated text
        via speech synthesis. The project integrates technologies such as
        speech-to-text (STT), language translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate
        API), and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Designed with a user-friendly
        interface to support multilingual communication, particularly beneficial
        for travelers, language learners, and cross-cultural interactions.
        Emphasized efficiency, accuracy, and low-latency performance in
        translation delivery.

      <li><h3>HRMS Leave Portal Project</h3></li>
      <p>
        Designed and developed a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) Leave
        Portal to streamline employee leave management within an organization.
        The system allows employees to apply for various types of leaves
        (casual, sick, earned, etc.), view their leave balance, and track
        application status. Managers can review, approve, or reject leave
        requests with automated notifications and audit trails. The portal
        features secure login, role-based access control, and a centralized
        dashboard for leave history and reports.
